# ynab-mono

Automatically imports transactions from Ukrainian digital bank [Monobank](https://www.monobank.ua/)
into [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) budgeting app.

I stopped using YNAB for personal finance management and currently transitioning to [Lunchmoney](https://lunchmoney.app)
and implementing it in this app. After that I plan to leave YNAB code as-is, without testing it, possibly in broken
state.
Last commit where YNAB support was working correctly, and I was personally using it
is [3a7da7af](https://github.com/smaugfm/ynab-mono/commit/3a7da7afd85bffa310f54a322c46d626d24f488c) (May 2022)
