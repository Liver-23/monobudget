# MonoBudget

Automatically imports transactions from Ukrainian digital bank [Monobank](https://www.monobank.ua/)
into [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) or [Lunchmoney](https://lunchmoney.app) budgeting apps.

Last commit where YNAB support was working in a "production" environment (I was personally using it)
is [3a7da7af](https://github.com/smaugfm/monobudget/commit/3a7da7afd85bffa310f54a322c46d626d24f488c) (May 2022)
